# PyBer_Analysis
# Overview of the analysis
# Purpose
The purpose of this assignment is using th python skills to analysis the ride sharing data by city type. Using the Pandas and Matplotlib, and create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. In order to have the final result, we will analysis the total number of rides, drivers, fares of rural, suburban and urban areas.

The above screenshots are the rides, drivers and fares amount of rural, suburban and urban areas. And it is obviously that urban area is the highest location of ride sharing, and rural area is th lowest area that use ride sharing. The total fares in urban area is almost 10 times of rural area.

By analyzing the PyBer summary DataFrame, we can see that the average fare per city in rural is higher than urban area. Even though th total rides and total drivers in urban area is much higher than rural. So i the average fare per driver. 
By looking at the diagram, it is very clear that from Jan--April, the fares of ride sharing in urban area is always the highest. Urban > Suburban > Rural.

# Summary
1. By analysing all the summary of urban, suburban and rural areas. This may cause by the destination distance differently in urban and rural areas. The fares were calculated by the distance of the rides. That causes the high fares in rural areas. Not everyone can affor high fares. If we are looking for a more accurate result, data collecting should also include the distances per ride fo each areas. 
2. By analysing the fares in urban areas, the fares per driver is the lowest, which is not even half of rural area. But the rides requirments in urban area is bery busy and high demand. Urban area is a busy place, so the company can increase the fare for rides, which can increase the income of drivers. by comparison, the company can decrease the fare fo rural area, since the destination distance is far for the most of them. By doing so, rural area driver can have more passengers.
3. Suburban area is in the middle, so the company can do some advertising fo suburban area to increase more rides and let more people know about ride-sharing to increase the total rides.
